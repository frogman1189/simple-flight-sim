# simple-flight-sim

A simple flight simulator implemented using JOGL. It has procedurally generated terrain, but lacks collision with objects. The flying movement is generally good but has a couple bugs, such as stalling being less smooth than it should and when over turning the intensity of the movement doesn't feel natural.
